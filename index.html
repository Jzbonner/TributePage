                  Charles Hamilton Houston, generally known as Charles H. Houston, was born on September 3, 1895, 
                  in Washington, D.C. In 1915, he graduated from Amherst College, where he was one of six valedictorians 
                  and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He taught English at Howard University before joining the U.S. Army 
                  during World War I.While serving in a segregated military unit, Houston saw that African-American service 
                  members were treated poorly, and could be convicted of crimes without any substantial evidence against 
                  them. Witnessing this unequal and unfair treatment made him decide to become a lawyer.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                  Houston's civil rights advocacy primarily focused on achieving recognition of African Americans' equal rights 
                  under law through the elimination of legally enforced racial discrimination. He argued that the status of African 
                  Americans as an oppressed minority necessitated the "complete elimination of segregation" through a protracted struggle 
                  including a legal campaign supported by a "sustaining mass interest," with "leadership . . . developing from the 
                  aspirations, determinations, sacrifices and needs of the group itself." He served as the first full-time, salaried 
                  special counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1935 to 1940. 
                </p>  
                <p class="body">  
                  He proposed in 1934 and thereafter implemented a strategy for overturning the "separate but equal" precedent of Plessy v. Ferguson 
                  (1896) to the end that racial discrimination and segregation might be declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
                  In recognition of courts' reliance on stare decisis and of widespread racism, Houston developed a long-range strategy of 
                  building favorable precedents over time until a direct attack on segregation per se could be made based upon such precedents 
                  rather than following one proposed earlier by Nathan Margold to make an immediate attack on segregation. Houston's 
                  strategy was implemented by the NAACP and later its Legal Defense and Educational Fund under Thurgood Marshall's direction.

                        in American society, his life is contextualized within the long Civil Rights Movement. Houston's work was intimately 
                        connected with many profound efforts to liberate those who were oppressed."
